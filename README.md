##### MME

The Mobility Management Entity(MME) is broken down into short lived stateless functions like attach_request, create_session_request, create_session_response etc. In the above diagram, MME is a collection of functions running on the serverless platform (currently AWS). When request arrives, appropriate function handler is invoked which does processing and invoke the next function for further processing.

##### SERVER 1

This server acts as a proxy between eNB and MME. The primary job of this proxy is to convert the s1ap messages to json payload and invoke the MME functions. Currently, `http_client` runs on SERVER1 which invokes `attach_request` function and listens for `attach_accept` after the bearers are setup.

##### SERVER 2

This server acts as a proxy between MME and SGW. The primary job of this proxy is to convert the http messages to gtpv-c message and send it to SGW. Currently, `http_server` runs on SERVER2 which listens for `create_session_req` message and replies by calling `create_session_res` function with `s1_sgw_teid` and `s5_pgw_teid`.

### Setup at cloud

Please see SETUP_<cloud_provider>.md. Eg, [SETUP_AWS.md](docs/SETUP_AWS.md)

### MME Setup

1. Run setup.sh in `attach_request`, `create_session_req`, `create_session_res` and `attach_accept`.
2. Run run.sh from all the above folders.
3. Use two cloudlab ubuntu 16.04 nodes.
4. Copy `http_enb` to one `server1` and `http_sgw` to another `server2`
5. Start `http_sgw` using `go run http_server.go`
6. Start `http_enb` using `go run http_client.go <server1_ip> <server2_ip>`
